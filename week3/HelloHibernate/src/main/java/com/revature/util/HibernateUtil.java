	 * Creating the HibernateUtil.java Helper File
	 * 
	 * To use Hibernate, you need to create a helper class that handles startup
	 * and access Hibernate's SessionFactory to obtain a Session object
	 * 
	 * 
	 * (interface)
	 * Session manages the connection to DB and provides CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
	 * 
	 * (class)
	 * Configuration's job is to gather info from the hiberate.cfg.xml file and then build the Session Factory.
	 * 
	 * (interface)
	 * Session Factory's job is to create sessions and store info on how
	 * to make connections to your DB
	 * 
	 * (interface) 
	 * Transaction manages..well...your transactions and cache (must be
	 * ACID).
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Query is used to write complex CRUD operations using HQL (Hibernate Query
	 * Language) 
	 * 
	 * Criteria is for programmatically writing Select queries
