# Week 6: Docker and Microservices

> *Below are some questions that may be asked about Docker & Web/Microservices.  Most likely 2 or 3 of the Docker questions will be asked in your cumulative QC.  They are good questions to research.* <br><br>
> *I suggest dedicating 85% of your time to MSA and 15% to Docker.*
<br>

## Microservice Questions ⁉️
> [Here](https://github.com/210222-reston-java-msa/demos/edit/main/week6/microservices.md) are the Microservice notes.
<br>

1.  Compare the microservice and monolithic architectures. What are the advantages / disadvantages of each?

2.  How do you solve the different problems inherent to microservices?

3.  What’s the difference between a MSA and a SOA?

4.  Can a Java microservice communicate with a Node.js microservice? Why or why not?

5.  What’s the difference between horizontal and vertical scalability? Which way do monoliths and microservices typically scale?

6.  What are some best practices for building microservices?

7.  How large should each service in a microservice be?

8.  What is a messaging queue and how is using one different from calling service APIs directly?

9.  Explain the Netflix OSS stack for microservices (Eureka, Zuul, Hystrix)

10.  How would you setup and configure Eureka? Zuul? Hystrix?

11.  What is the purpose of an API gateway and how does Zuul perform this?

12.  What is service discovery and how does Eureka do this (we used Consul)?

13.  What is the circuit breaker pattern and how does Hystrix implement it?
<br>

### SOAP Questions ⁉️

14.  What does the acronym SOAP stand for?

15.  What protocols and data format do SOAP services use?

16.  What is the “contract” for a SOAP service?

17.  What’s the structure of a SOAP message?

18.  What are the SOAP messaging modes? Messaging Exchange Patterns?

19.  Are SOAP messages delivered with GET or POST requests?
<br>
    
### REST Questions ⁉️

20.  What does the acronym REST stand for? What makes a service “RESTful”?  

21.  What protocols and data format do REST services use?  

22.  What are the architectural constraints of REST?  

23.  What is a “resource” in a REST service?  

24.  What does the “uniform interface” constraint mean? Give an example of some RESTful endpoints you would create for an API. Should the URLs contain nouns, verbs, or adjectives?    
<br>

## Docker Questions ⁉️
*Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.*

> [Here](https://github.com/210222-reston-java-msa/demos/blob/main/week6/docker.md) are the notes and guide on Docker
<br>

1.  What is containerization?
    
2.  What is the Docker Daemon?
    
3.  How are containers different from virtual machines? What makes docker containers more lightweight than virtual machines?
    
4.  What is a Docker image? Container?
    
5.  How is a Docker image different from a Docker container? How are the read/write layers different?
    
6.  List the steps to start Docker, create a Docker image, and spin up a container.
    
7.  What is the relevance of the Dockerfile to this process? List some keywords in the Dockerfile.
    
8.  What is the benefit to an image being built in Layers?
    
9.  What are some other Docker commands?
    
10.  What is a container registry? How would you retrieve and upload images to DockerHub?
    
11.  What is Docker compose and why is it useful?
    
12.  If you want to store state for a container, how does Docker recommend doing that?
