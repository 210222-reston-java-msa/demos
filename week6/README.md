# Week 6: Docker and Microservices

> *Below are some questions that may be asked about Docker, most likely 2 or 3 of these will be asked in your cumulative QC.  They are good questions to research.* <br><br>
> *Note that I've also included MicroService Questions.  I suggest dedicating 85% of your time to MSA and 15% to Docker.*

## Docker
*Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.*
