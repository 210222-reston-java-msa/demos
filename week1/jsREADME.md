## JavaScript Language Fundamentals

1.  What is JavaScript? What do we use it for?
2.  Can we run JavaScript in a web browser, on a server, or both?
3.  [What programming paradigm(s) does JS support?](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/what-are-javascript-programming-paradigms-3ef0f576dfdb)
    > JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.
4.  What are the data types in JS?
    - What is the type of NaN? What is the isNaN function?
    - What is the data type of a function?

5.  What are JS objects? what is the syntax?
6.  What is JSON? Is it different from JS objects?
    > Unlike JavaScript Object, a JSON Object has to be fed into a variable as a String and then parsed into JavaScript. A framework like jQuery can be very helpful when doing parsing.

8.  What are the different scopes of variables in JS?
    - What are the different ways to declare global variables?
    - Is it a best practice to use global variables? Why or why not?
9.  What is function and variable hoisting?
10.  What is the global object in client-side JavaScript?
    - What are some built-in functions (methods on the global object)? 
11. What are callback functions? What about self-invoking functions?
12.  What is closure and when should you use it?
13.  Use the object literal syntax to create an object with some properties
14.  What is a truthy or falsy value? List the falsy values.
15.  What is the difference between == and ===? Which one allows for type coercion?
16.  Explain the template literal syntax
17.  What are arrays in JS? can you change their size?
18.  Explain what “strict mode” does
19.  Explain how inheritance works in JS
20.  What does the "this" keyword refer to?
21.  Explain the concept of lexical scope
22.  What will happen when I try to run this code: console.log(0.1+0.2==0.3) ?
    
### ES6+
23.  What new features did ES6 introduce?
24.  What is the difference between var, let, and const keywords?
25.  Does JS have classes? If so, when were they introduced?

### Events and DOM
26.  What is the DOM? How is it represented as a data structure? What object in a browser environment allows us to interact with the DOM?
27.  List some ways of querying the DOM for elements
28.  How would you insert a new element into the DOM?
29.  What are event listeners? What are some events we can listen for? What are some different ways of setting event listeners?
