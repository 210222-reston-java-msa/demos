<br>
The code in the respective files `jeopardy.html` and `jeopardy.js` produces a simple application that sends an AJAX request to the [jService](http://jservice.io/) API.  To build upon your JavaScript/HTML/CSS skills, try replicating the code in VScode on your own.  You can style the page however you like and add your own personal touches. <br>

You may ask *Well how am I learning anything by copying code?*.  To that I reply, see if you can truly understand what's going on in the code, then add your own personal touches.

#### Strech Goal
- Modify the JavaScript file to make an HTTP request with the `Fetch` API, *instead* of using the `XMLHttpRequest` Object.
- Implement Bootstrap
